On Saturday, Word got out that [Western Digital have already sold all of their hard drive capacity for 2026 to AI bros](https://wccftech.com/western-digital-has-no-more-hdd-capacity-left-out/).  Following other tranches of bad news starting with [Sam Altman's Dirty DRam Deal](https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal) last october, many computer components are becoming too expensive for the average consumer to purchase. 

There has been talk of a conspiracy by [[The Epstein Class]] to prevent us proles from owning computers and to rent them back to us, like they have done with everything else. My opinion, partly informed by both Occam and Hanlon's razors, is that this is just the [[MBAs|Major Business Assholes]] that run these companies following their nose towards a quick buck. After all, line must go up. It doesn't seem far-fetched to think that the CEO of Western Digital looked at the stunt that [Micron Pulled with Crucial](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business) and thought "yes I want some of that please".

So, it might be time to go and grab that laptop out of the loft and order a new LiPo battery for it before the lithium miners join in the fun and sell all their future lithium reserves to Sam Altman [so that he can sleep at night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)).
