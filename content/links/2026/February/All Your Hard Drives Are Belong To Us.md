On Saturday, Word got out that [Western Digital have already sold all of their hard drive capacity for 2026 to AI bros](https://wccftech.com/western-digital-has-no-more-hdd-capacity-left-out/).  Following other tranches of bad news starting with [Sam Altman's Dirty DRam Deal](https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal) last october, many computer components are becoming too expensive for the average consumer to purchase. There has been talk of a conspiracy by [[The Epstein Class]] to prevent us proles from owning computers and to rent them back to us, like they have done with everything else. My opinion, partly informed by both Occam and Hanlon's razors, is that this is just the [[MBAs|Major Business Assholes]] that run these companies following their nose towards a quick buck. After all, line must go up.
