Welcome to svines.rodeo. I am Sam Vines, a software engineer with 15+ years professional experience, based in the UK.

I am deeply suspicious of the techbro culture around AI and LLMs and I have formal post-graduate education and 10+ years as a professional data science and machine learning practitioner so I am pretty well positioned to understand the grift.
