Welcome to svines.rodeo. I am Sam Vines, a software engineer with 15+ years professional experience, based in the UK. 

I am passionate about developing highly performant systems that use hardware resources sparingly.

I am deeply suspicious of the techbro culture and the [[MBAs]] infestation of AI and LLMs. I have formal post-graduate education and 10+ years as a professional data science and machine learning practitioner so I am pretty well positioned to understand the grift.
