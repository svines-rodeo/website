Besides being obnoxiously rich and frequently using words like “synergy”, what do the executive teams of [big tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech#magnificent_seven) firms mostly have in common? [If you said “feature heavily in the epstein files”, that's not a bad guess](https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/) but not the answer I was looking for... The answer is that  most of them have a Masters in Business Administration or MBAs. 

Notionally, MBAs are prestigious post-graduate degrees that grant the holder the power to build a unicorn startup that can be sold to some big corporate #BagHolder. However, in reality, the MBA system is one of the most successful cults and modern day grifts of our time.


## Who gets an MBA?

There are typically two types of MBA holders: 

1. Ghoulish [[Epstein Class]] bros whose dad paid for them to go to a prestigious college to get an MBA - these people understand the grift and why being a member of the MBA cult is advantageous to them.
2. Tragically misled technical leaders and mediocre middle managers who earnestly believe that the content on MBA courses is what's relevant and don't realise that the cult is the point.


## why are MBA-holders so widely acclaimed?

Simple, holding an MBA is like a secret handshake, a dog whistle, a cult membership test. If you have one you are a member of an exclusive group of despicable people and other MBAs and [[Epstein Class]] people see that as a badge of respect. 

An MBA rocking up at your business is just like a nazi turning up at your bar. They're well networked and they'll pack your business with fellow master assholes before you know it. You've gotta toss ‘em out on their ass as soon as they start talking about “this one time at Harvard...”
